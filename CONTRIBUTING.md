# Contributing

We welcome all kinds of contributions, including bug reports, feature requests,
documentation improvements, and code contributions.

## Creating Issues

If you have found a bug, or would like to request a new feature, please create
an issue on the project's issue tracker. When creating an issue, please provide
as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the bug and any
relevant error messages, stack traces, or files.

## Contributing Code

If you would like to contribute to the `gvas` crate by submitting changes,
there are a few steps you should follow:

1. Fork the [gvas](https://github.com/localcc/gvas) repository on GitHub.
1. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
1. Create a new branch for your changes.
1. Make the necessary changes and commit them to your branch.
1. Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
1. Create a pull request from your branch to the gvas repository.

Before making any changes, it is a good idea to read through the existing code
and documentation to get a sense of how things work. Additionally, it is
important to write tests for any changes you make to ensure that they do not
introduce bugs or regressions.

When creating a pull request, be sure to include a clear and concise
description of the changes you made and why they are necessary. The maintainers
will review your changes and provide feedback, which you should incorporate
into your code as needed.
